# Graphs

A set of values that are reated in a pairwise fashion. 
A graph is like a network, consisting of nodes(vertexes) and edges(connections between them). 

Graphs are good for modelling real life relationships, like towns and roads or people and friendships etc. 

Trees are a type of graph and so LinkedLists are also a type of graph. 

## Directed v Undirected

Graphs can be directed or undirected, meaning the relationship exists in a certain direction. 
For example followers on instagram, or one way streets, or subscriptions. 

## Cyclic v Acyclic

The connections in a graph form a loop/cycle or not. 

## Weighted v Unweighted

The edges of a graph have associated weights, these could represent road distanes or wait times, when calculating fastest route to destination for example. 

## Storing a Graph

A graph could be stored with edge list, adjacency list or adjacency matrix. 

# DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph

Useful for data processing flows since we can clearly organise steps in order. 

# Summary 

Many types of graphs, useful for storing various relationships.
Many algorithms to search, traverse and update.
