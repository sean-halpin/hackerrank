# Stacks and Queues

Linear Data structures - only one item accessible at a time. 

## Stacks

Analogous to a stack of plates
LIFO
lookup O(n)
pop/push/peek O(1)

Implement with Array;
Implement with Linked List;

Array should be more efficient
LinkedList should be more dynamic

## Queues

Analogous to a queue of people in a shop
FIFO
lookup O(n)
enqueue/deqeueu/enqueue O(1)

Implement with Array;
Implement with Linked List;

LinkedList should be more dynamic
LinkedList should be more efficient
Array not great, because of shifting of elements and fixed size.
