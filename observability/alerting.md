# Grafana Alerting

Grafana alerts allow you to monitor and notify about changes or issues in your metrics and data. Here's how they work:

- **Alert Rules**: You define alert rules based on your metrics and conditions. These rules specify when an alert should be triggered.

- **Notification Policies**: Notification policies determine who should be notified when an alert is triggered. You can create multiple notification policies to handle different scenarios.

- **Contact Points**: Contact points are the recipients of the notifications. They can be individuals or groups, such as email addresses, Slack channels, or PagerDuty integrations.

- **Alert Channels**: Alert channels are the means through which notifications are sent. Grafana supports various alert channels, including email, Slack, PagerDuty, and more.

- **Alert States**: When an alert is triggered, it goes through different states, such as "pending," "firing," and "resolved." These states help track the lifecycle of an alert.

- **Dashboard Integration**: Grafana alerts can be integrated with dashboards, allowing you to visualize and manage alerts alongside your metrics.

By configuring alert rules, notification policies, contact points, and alert channels, you can effectively monitor your metrics and ensure timely notifications when issues arise.
