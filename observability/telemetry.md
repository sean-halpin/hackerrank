# Telemetry

Distributed traces are used to monitor and analyze the flow of requests across multiple services in a distributed system. They provide a detailed view of the entire request path, capturing information about each service involved and the time taken at each step. 

Distributed traces contain data such as trace ID, span ID, parent span ID, timestamps, and metadata. Trace ID uniquely identifies a request, while span ID represents an individual operation within the trace. Parent span ID links spans together to form a trace tree.

## Grafana Alloy

Grafana Alloy is a distributed tracing backend that provides a scalable and high-performance storage solution for traces. It allows for efficient storage and retrieval of trace data, enabling fast analysis and visualization.

## Grafana Tempo

Grafana Tempo is a distributed tracing system that focuses on high ingest rates and long-term storage of traces. It is designed to handle massive amounts of trace data and provides a cost-effective solution for storing and querying traces over extended periods.

Both Grafana Alloy and Grafana Tempo can be used to collect and visualize traces. They integrate with popular observability tools and frameworks, allowing developers to easily instrument their applications and capture trace data. These tools provide powerful query and visualization capabilities, enabling users to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues in their distributed systems.

When using Grafana Alloy and Grafana Tempo, it is important to consider the scalability and storage requirements of your trace data. These systems are designed to handle large volumes of traces, so proper capacity planning is crucial. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the instrumentation in your applications is correctly configured to capture the necessary trace data without impacting performance.
