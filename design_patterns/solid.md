# Solid Design Principles

Introduced by Robert C Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, the SOLID design principles are a set of guidelines that help software developers write clean, maintainable, and scalable code. The SOLID acronym stands for:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job or responsibility. This principle helps to keep classes small and focused, making them easier to understand and maintain.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that classes should be designed in a way that allows new functionality to be added without changing the existing code. This principle helps to prevent bugs and regressions in the existing codebase.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes without changing the behavior of the program. This principle helps to ensure that inheritance is used correctly and that polymorphism is implemented properly.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The Interface Segregation Principle states that a client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. This means that classes should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not need. Instead, interfaces should be broken down into smaller, more specific interfaces so that clients can implement only the methods they require. This principle helps to prevent unnecessary dependencies and reduce coupling between classes.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. In addition, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This principle helps to decouple modules and make them more flexible and reusable.

By following the SOLID design principles, developers can create code that is easier to maintain, test, and extend. These principles help to reduce complexity, improve code quality, and promote best practices in software development.
