# Event Driven Microservices

Covering
- Async comms, decoupled comms
- Event Hubs
- Stream-Processing
- Real-time processing
- High volume Events

Considerations
- What if we have thousands of microservices and need to communicate millions of events
- Multiple msvcs process same events?
- Real-time processing requirement
- Complex event processing, pattern matching?
- High volume/velocity apps, like IoT?

Problems
- Decoupled comms for 1000s of msvcs
- Real-time processing
- High Volume Events

Solution
- Event Driven Arch for Microservices

Event Driven Arch

- Microservices architectures are designed to be highly
modular and flexible, that can be scaled and managed
separately and use of APIs to communicate between services.
- Event-driven architecture, microservices can communicate
by publishing and subscribing to events, than directly calling
each other's APIs.
- Event-driven microservice architecture is means
communicating with microservices via event messages and
we can do asynchronous behavior and loosely coupled.
- Instead of sending request when data needed, services
consume them via events.
- Huge Innovations on the Event-Driven Microservices
Architectures;
- Real-time messaging platforms, stream-processing, event
hubs, real-time processing, batch processing, data
intelligence.

# Event Driven Arch

- Services communicate by publishing & subscribing to events
- Pub/Sub allows async comms & decoupled comms
- Real time processing, can use Event driven arch + CQRS + pub/sub to scale as needed
- High Volume events similar as above

##Â Real time processing & high volume events

- Real time
  - Events pub to message queue or event bus for interested subscribers
  - Allows reactions in real time
- High Volume
  - Event bus can be scaled horizontally as needed
  - Many consumers can process in parallel

Event Driven Arch good choice for both scenarios

## Event Hubs & Event Streaming

- Event Hubs can be used as central hub for data ingestion & distribution
- Allowing microservices to publish & subsrcibe to data streams

Example event hubs are Kafka, Spark(realtime)

 - Cloud event hubs
   - azure events hubs
   - AWS Kinesis
   - Oracle Event Hubs

## Evaluate Event Driven Architecture

- Benefits
  - Event Streaming
  - Real-time Processing
  - High Volume Events
  - Decouple Services, increased Stability
  - Resilience
- Drawbacks
  - Complex design
  - Difficult Debugging
  - Add Latecny to event publishing process
  - Integration into distributed transactions
  - Difficult to set up & maintain


- Considerations
  - Database operations are expensive, low performance
  - Latency of pub/sub for message passing
  - Events which request from DB could access db for every event
  - Sync API request from DB could access db for every event
- Problem
  - Slow comms
  - Latency of pub/sub
  - REST APIs that make db calls expensive
- Solutions
  - Distributed Cache
  - Storing frequenctly accessed data in cache
